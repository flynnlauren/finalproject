                        Ross Geller, the only person you will ever meet to have his PHD and gets to play 
                        with dinosaurs. Ross is a devoted paleontologist and Monica's older nerdy broter. 
                        Ross is constantly in an on again off again relationship with Rachel, and he is 
                        the man known for having the most marriages. Ross just has bad luck with the 
                        ladies but is an all around sweet heart.

                        Phoebe Buffay is not your average ordinary friend. She can sometimes see into
                        the future, or know that her mom's spirit is trapped inside a cat's body. Phoebe 
                        finds her long lost brother and eventually has his babies. It sounds weirder than 
                        you think, but she became a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife. Phoebe
                        is well known for her use of words especially when it comes to the "phalanges".

                        How you doin? If you ever hear that with a man eating a sandwitch you know its Joey.
                        Joey is Chandler's roommate and is best known for his acting as Dr. Drake Amore on 
                        Days of Our Lives. Aside from all the acting Joey is one of the best characters on 
                        Friends. He may not be the smartest, or the fastest, but he's a Tribbiani and he 
                        sure can eat. So ladies if you have maternity pants HIDE THEM!! Because he will 
                        make use out of them at the thanksgiving dinner table.
